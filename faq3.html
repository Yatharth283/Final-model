    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions - Metals and Non-Metals</h1>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>1. Define corrosion. What is the specific term for the corrosion of iron? Why is it considered a serious problem, and how can it be prevented?</h2>
        <p>Corrosion is the gradual destruction of metals due to reactions with environmental factors such as moisture and air. The corrosion of iron is specifically termed <strong>rusting</strong>. It weakens iron structures, causing safety hazards and economic losses. It can be prevented by painting, galvanization, oiling, and electroplating.</p>

        <h2>2. Explain the process and conditions under which iron rusts.</h2>
        <p>Iron rusts when exposed to both oxygen and water. The reaction forms hydrated iron(III) oxide (Fe₂O₃·xH₂O), commonly known as rust. This process accelerates in the presence of electrolytes like salt.</p>

        <h2>3. Why do some metal surfaces acquire a dull appearance when exposed to moist air?</h2>
        <p>Metals react with oxygen and moisture in the air, forming oxides or other compounds that cause a dull appearance. For example, copper forms a greenish layer of copper carbonate, and silver forms a black coating of silver sulfide.</p>

        <h2>4. Describe an activity to demonstrate the conditions necessary for iron to rust.</h2>
        <p>Take three test tubes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Test tube A: Iron nails in water → rusts</li>
            <li>Test tube B: Iron nails in boiled water with oil → does not rust</li>
            <li>Test tube C: Dry iron nails → does not rust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This shows that both oxygen and water are needed for rusting.</p>

        <h2>5. A metal 'X' combines with a non-metal 'Y' by transferring electrons to form compound 'Z'.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>(i) <strong>Type of bond in compound Z:</strong> Ionic bond</li>
            <li>(ii) <strong>Melting & boiling points:</strong> High due to strong electrostatic forces</li>
            <li>(iii) <strong>Solubility in kerosene/petrol:</strong> Insoluble (ionic compounds dissolve in water, not in non-polar solvents)</li>
            <li>(iv) <strong>Electrical conductivity:</strong> Conducts electricity in molten/aqueous state but not in solid form</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Differentiate between metals and non-metals based on their chemical properties.</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Metals:</strong> Lose electrons, form basic oxides, react with acids to produce hydrogen gas.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-Metals:</strong> Gain electrons, form acidic oxides, do not react with acids.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. What are amphoteric oxides? Identify them among Na₂O, ZnO, CO₂, Al₂O₃, H₂O.</h2>
        <p>Amphoteric oxides react with both acids and bases. Among the given options, <strong>ZnO</strong> (Zinc Oxide) and <strong>Al₂O₃</strong> (Aluminum Oxide) are amphoteric.</p>

        <h2>8. Why is copper used to make hot water tanks instead of steel?</h2>
        <p>Copper is less reactive than iron and does not react with hot water, preventing rusting and ensuring durability. Steel (iron alloy) can rust when exposed to hot water.</p>
