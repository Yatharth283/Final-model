        <h1>Class 10 Science - Electricity (FAQs)</h1>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="question">1. State Ohm's Law. How can it be verified experimentally?</div>
            <div class="answer">Ohm's Law states that the voltage (V) across a conductor is directly proportional to the current (I) flowing through it, provided the temperature remains constant. This relationship is given by the equation: V = IR, where R is the resistance of the conductor. 
            
            To verify Ohm’s Law experimentally, a circuit is set up using a resistor, an ammeter, a voltmeter, and a battery. The voltage across the resistor is varied using a variable power source, and the corresponding current is measured using the ammeter. The readings are recorded, and a graph of voltage versus current is plotted. If the graph is a straight line passing through the origin, it confirms Ohm’s Law.</div>
            
            <div class="question">2. Derive the expression for the equivalent resistance in series and parallel.</div>
            <div class="answer">When resistors are connected in series, the same current flows through each resistor, and the total voltage across them is the sum of the individual voltages. The equivalent resistance is given by:
            
            R_eq = R1 + R2 + R3 ...
            
            In parallel circuits, the voltage across each resistor is the same, while the total current is the sum of the currents through each resistor. The equivalent resistance is given by:
            
            1/R_eq = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 ...
            
            Parallel circuits are preferred in homes because they provide independent functioning of appliances.</div>
            
            <div class="question">3. Define electrical resistivity. How does it differ from resistance?</div>
            <div class="answer">Electrical resistivity is a material-specific property that defines how strongly a material opposes the flow of electric current. It is represented by the symbol \( \rho \) and is given by:
            
            \( R = \rho \frac{L}{A} \),
            
            where L is the length and A is the cross-sectional area of the conductor.
            
            Resistance depends on the material's resistivity, as well as its dimensions, whereas resistivity is a fundamental property of the material itself.</div>
            
            <div class="question">4. Explain the concept of electric power. Derive the relation P = VI.</div>
            <div class="answer">Electric power is the rate at which electrical energy is consumed by a device. It is given by:
            
            P = VI, where V is voltage and I is current.
            
            Using Ohm’s Law (V = IR), we also derive P = I²R and P = V²/R.</div>
            
            <div class="question">5. What is the heating effect of electric current? Derive the formula H = I²Rt.</div>
            <div class="answer">When an electric current flows through a conductor, it produces heat due to resistance. This is given by Joule’s Law of Heating:
            
            H = I²Rt,
            
            where H is heat produced, I is current, R is resistance, and t is time. This principle is used in electric heaters and fuses.</div>
            
            <div class="question">6. What is a fuse? Why is it used in electrical circuits?</div>
            <div class="answer">A fuse is a safety device that prevents excessive current from flowing through a circuit. It consists of a thin wire that melts when current exceeds a safe limit, thereby breaking the circuit and preventing damage.</div>
            
            <div class="question">7. What is the difference between a voltmeter and an ammeter?</div>
            <div class="answer">A voltmeter measures potential difference and is connected in parallel, while an ammeter measures current and is connected in series.</div>
            
            <div class="question">8. What is the difference between AC and DC? Which one is supplied to our homes?</div>
            <div class="answer">AC reverses direction periodically, while DC flows in one direction. Household supply is AC (220V, 50Hz in India) because it is easier to transmit over long distances.</div>
            
            <div class="question">9. What do you mean by electric potential and potential difference?</div>
            <div class="answer">Electric potential is the work done to move a unit charge. Potential difference is the work required to move a charge between two points.</div>
            
            <div class="question">10. Why are parallel circuits preferred over series circuits in household wiring?</div>
            <div class="answer">Parallel circuits allow independent operation of appliances, provide the same voltage to all devices, and offer better safety and control.</div>
