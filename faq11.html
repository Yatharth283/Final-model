            <h2>1. Describe the structure and working of the human eye.</h2>
            <p>The human eye is a spherical structure that consists of several parts, including the cornea, iris, pupil, lens, retina, and optic nerve. The cornea allows light to enter the eye and focuses it on the lens. The iris controls the amount of light entering through the pupil. The lens further focuses light onto the retina, where an inverted image is formed. The optic nerve then transmits this image to the brain, where it is interpreted correctly.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>2. What is the power of accommodation of the human eye? Explain with an example.</h2>
            <p>The power of accommodation is the ability of the eye to adjust the focal length of the lens to focus on objects at varying distances. The ciliary muscles play a key role in this process by changing the shape of the lens. For example, when we look at a distant object, the ciliary muscles relax, making the lens thinner, while for a nearby object, they contract, making the lens thicker.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>3. What are the defects of vision in the human eye? How can they be corrected?</h2>
            <p>The three common defects of vision are:
            <br><strong>Myopia (Nearsightedness)</strong> - A condition where distant objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eye is too elongated or the cornea is too curved. It is corrected using concave lenses.
            <br><strong>Hypermetropia (Farsightedness)</strong> - A condition where nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is too short. It is corrected using convex lenses.
            <br><strong>Presbyopia</strong> - A condition that occurs with aging, making it difficult to focus on close objects. Bifocal lenses are used for correction.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>4. What is the least distance of distinct vision? Why does it change with age?</h2>
            <p>The least distance of distinct vision is the minimum distance at which an object can be seen clearly without strain, which is 25 cm for a normal human eye. With age, the eye lens loses flexibility, making it harder to focus on close objects, which increases this distance.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>5. Explain the phenomenon of dispersion of light with a prism.</h2>
            <p>Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors when it passes through a prism. This happens because different colors of light bend at different angles due to their varying wavelengths. The order of colors obtained is called the spectrum of light, which includes violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red (VIBGYOR).</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>6. Why is the sky blue? Explain using Rayleigh’s scattering law.</h2>
            <p>The sky appears blue due to the scattering of sunlight by air molecules. According to Rayleigh’s law, shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) scatter more than longer wavelengths (red and yellow). Since our eyes are more sensitive to blue light, the sky appears blue.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>7. Why does the sun appear red during sunrise and sunset?</h2>
            <p>During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to pass through a thicker layer of the atmosphere. The shorter wavelengths (blue and violet) are scattered away, leaving the longer wavelengths (red and orange), making the sun appear red.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>8. What is the twinkling of stars? Why don’t planets twinkle?</h2>
            <p>Stars twinkle due to atmospheric refraction. The changing densities of air cause the light from stars to bend, making them appear to fluctuate in brightness. Planets do not twinkle because they are closer and appear as larger discs, so any fluctuations average out.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>9. What is a rainbow? How is it formed?</h2>
            <p>A rainbow is formed due to the refraction, dispersion, and total internal reflection of sunlight in water droplets. Sunlight enters the droplet, bends, splits into its component colors, reflects off the inner surface of the droplet, and then exits, creating a rainbow.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>10. What is the function of the retina in the human eye? How do rod and cone cells help in vision?</h2>
            <p>The retina is a light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye that contains photoreceptor cells. Rod cells help in vision under low-light conditions (night vision), while cone cells help in color vision under bright light.</p>
