        <h1>Magnetic Effects of Electric Current</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Magnetic effects of electric current refer to the phenomenon where a current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it. This concept is the foundation of electromagnetism and is used in various devices like electric motors, generators, and transformers.</p>
        
        <h2>Magnet and Its Properties</h2>
        <p>A magnet is a material that produces a magnetic field, which attracts or repels materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt. A freely suspended magnet always points toward the Earth's geographic north-south direction.</p>
        
        <h2>Magnetic Field and Field Lines</h2>
        <p>A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where its influence is felt. The field lines indicate the strength and direction of the magnetic field. Important properties include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Magnetic field lines form closed loops.</li>
            <li>They emerge from the north pole and enter the south pole outside the magnet.</li>
            <li>Denser field lines indicate a stronger field.</li>
            <li>Field lines never intersect.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Oersted's Experiment</h2>
        <p>Danish physicist Hans Christian Oersted discovered that a current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field. A magnetic compass placed near the wire deflects when current flows, proving that electricity and magnetism are related.</p>
        
        <h2>Right-Hand Thumb Rule</h2>
        <p>If you hold a current-carrying conductor in your right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of current, then the curled fingers show the direction of the magnetic field.</p>
        
        <h2>Magnetic Field Due to a Current-Carrying Coil</h2>
        <p>A circular coil carrying current behaves like a bar magnet. The field lines form concentric circles around the wire and resemble a uniform field inside the coil.</p>
        
        <h2>Magnetic Field in a Solenoid</h2>
        <p>A solenoid is a coil of wire wound in a cylindrical shape. When current flows, it produces a strong magnetic field similar to a bar magnet. Solenoids are used in electromagnets, which can be turned on and off by controlling the current.</p>
        
        <h2>Force on a Current-Carrying Conductor</h2>
        <p>When a conductor carrying current is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a force perpendicular to both the current and the field. This is the principle behind electric motors.</p>
        
        <h2>Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule</h2>
        <p>It states that if you stretch the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your left hand perpendicular to each other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forefinger represents the magnetic field direction.</li>
            <li>Middle finger represents the current direction.</li>
            <li>Thumb represents the force direction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Electric Motor</h2>
        <p>An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy using electromagnetic forces. It consists of a coil placed in a magnetic field, which experiences a force when current flows, causing rotation.</p>
        
        <h2>Electromagnetic Induction</h2>
        <p>Michael Faraday discovered that a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a nearby conductor. This phenomenon is called electromagnetic induction.</p>
        
        <h2>Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule</h2>
        <p>It states that if you stretch the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of your right hand perpendicular to each other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Forefinger represents the magnetic field direction.</li>
            <li>Thumb represents the motion direction.</li>
            <li>Middle finger represents the induced current direction.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Electric Generator</h2>
        <p>An electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy using electromagnetic induction. It consists of a rotating coil in a magnetic field, inducing current.</p>
        
        <h2>Domestic Electric Circuits</h2>
        <p>Home wiring consists of live, neutral, and earth wires. Safety devices like fuses and circuit breakers prevent overloading and short circuits.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The magnetic effects of electric current play a crucial role in modern technology, from motors and generators to transformers and communication systems.</p>
