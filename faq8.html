        <h1>Chapter 8 - How Do Organisms Reproduce?</h1>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>1. Why is reproduction necessary for organisms?</h2>
            <p>Reproduction is essential for the survival and continuity of species. It ensures the transfer of genetic material from one generation to the next and helps maintain population stability. It also plays a crucial role in evolution by introducing variations through genetic recombination.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>2. What are the different types of reproduction? Explain with examples.</h2>
            <p>Reproduction is classified into two types: asexual and sexual reproduction.</p>
            <p><b>Asexual reproduction:</b> A single organism produces offspring without the involvement of gametes. Examples include binary fission in bacteria, budding in yeast, and vegetative propagation in plants.</p>
            <p><b>Sexual reproduction:</b> It involves the fusion of male and female gametes, resulting in genetically diverse offspring. Examples include reproduction in humans, flowering plants, and animals like frogs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>3. Describe the process of binary fission with an example.</h2>
            <p>Binary fission is an asexual reproduction method where a single parent cell divides into two identical daughter cells. The process occurs in unicellular organisms like Amoeba and Bacteria. During binary fission:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The nucleus elongates and splits into two.</li>
                <li>The cytoplasm divides, forming two daughter cells.</li>
                <li>Each daughter cell grows independently.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This process enables rapid population growth under favorable conditions.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>4. Explain budding with an example.</h2>
            <p>Budding is a type of asexual reproduction where a new individual grows as a bud on the parent organism. The bud develops, matures, and eventually detaches to become an independent organism. Yeast and Hydra reproduce by budding. In Hydra, a small outgrowth forms on the body, enlarges, and separates from the parent.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>5. What is vegetative propagation? Mention its advantages.</h2>
            <p>Vegetative propagation is an asexual reproduction method in which new plants grow from vegetative parts like roots, stems, or leaves. Examples include potato tubers, ginger rhizomes, and rose stem cuttings.</p>
            <p><b>Advantages:</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Faster reproduction than seeds.</li>
                <li>Produces genetically identical plants.</li>
                <li>Maintains desirable traits in plants.</li>
                <li>Helps grow seedless plants like bananas.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>6. Describe the structure of a flower with a labeled diagram.</h2>
            <p>A flower consists of the following parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Sepals:</b> Protect the flower bud.</li>
                <li><b>Petals:</b> Attract pollinators.</li>
                <li><b>Stamens:</b> Male reproductive parts containing pollen.</li>
                <li><b>Carpels:</b> Female reproductive organ containing the ovary.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>7. What is pollination? Differentiate between self-pollination and cross-pollination.</h2>
            <p>Pollination is the transfer of pollen from an anther to a stigma. It is of two types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Self-pollination:</b> Pollen is transferred within the same flower or plant (e.g., pea plant).</li>
                <li><b>Cross-pollination:</b> Pollen is transferred between different plants of the same species (e.g., apple, sunflower).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>8. Explain the process of fertilization in plants.</h2>
            <p>Fertilization occurs when a pollen grain reaches the stigma, forming a pollen tube that carries the male gamete to the ovule inside the ovary. The male gamete fuses with the female gamete, forming a zygote that develops into a seed.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>9. How does the human male and female reproductive system function?</h2>
            <p><b>Male:</b> The testes produce sperm, which travel through the vas deferens, mixing with seminal fluids before being expelled through the penis.</p>
            <p><b>Female:</b> The ovaries release eggs, which travel through the fallopian tubes. If fertilized by sperm, the zygote implants in the uterus for development.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>10. Describe the menstrual cycle and its importance.</h2>
            <p>The menstrual cycle is a 28-day cycle where the uterus prepares for pregnancy. If no fertilization occurs, the uterine lining sheds (menstruation).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>11. What is the difference between sexual and asexual reproduction?</h2>
            <p>Sexual reproduction involves two parents and creates genetic diversity, whereas asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces identical offspring.</p>
