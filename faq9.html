        <div class="faq">
            <h2>1. What is heredity? Explain the role of genes in heredity.</h2>
            <p>Heredity is the passing of traits from parents to offspring through genes. Genes, which are segments of DNA located on chromosomes, control characteristics such as eye color, height, and hair texture. Each parent contributes one allele for a trait, and the combination of these alleles determines the offspring’s characteristics.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>2. Explain Mendel’s experiment on pea plants and mention its conclusions.</h2>
            <p>Gregor Mendel conducted experiments on pea plants to study inheritance patterns. He cross-pollinated tall and short plants and observed that the first generation (F1) only had tall plants. However, in the second generation (F2), the short plants reappeared in a 3:1 ratio. This led to the principles of dominance, segregation, and independent assortment.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>3. What is the difference between dominant and recessive traits? Give examples.</h2>
            <p>Dominant traits appear even if only one dominant allele is present, while recessive traits appear only if both alleles are recessive. For example, in Mendel’s experiments, tallness in pea plants was dominant, whereas shortness was recessive.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>4. Explain how sex is determined in human beings.</h2>
            <p>Sex determination in humans is based on chromosomes. Males have XY chromosomes, and females have XX. The sperm from the father carries either an X or a Y chromosome, while the mother always provides an X chromosome. If the sperm carries an X, the child will be female (XX); if it carries a Y, the child will be male (XY).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>5. What are variations? How do they contribute to evolution?</h2>
            <p>Variations are differences in traits among individuals of the same species. These variations arise due to genetic mutations and recombination during reproduction. Variations that offer survival advantages become common in a population over generations, leading to evolution.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>6. What is natural selection? How does it lead to evolution?</h2>
            <p>Natural selection is the process by which organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce, while those with unfavorable traits perish. Over time, advantageous traits become dominant in a population, leading to evolutionary changes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>7. What are fossils? How do they help in tracing evolutionary relationships?</h2>
            <p>Fossils are preserved remains of ancient organisms found in sedimentary rocks. They provide evidence of how species have changed over time. Fossil records show transitional forms, helping scientists understand the evolutionary history of life on Earth.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>8. What is the difference between homologous and analogous organs? Give examples.</h2>
            <p>Homologous organs have the same structure but different functions, like a human arm and a bat’s wing. Analogous organs have different structures but similar functions, like the wings of a butterfly and a bird.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>9. Explain the Hardy-Weinberg Principle.</h2>
            <p>The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele frequencies in a population remain constant if evolutionary influences such as mutation, selection, and migration do not occur. It helps in studying genetic equilibrium.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>10. What are acquired and inherited traits? Give examples.</h2>
            <p>Acquired traits develop during an organism’s lifetime due to environmental influences and are not passed to offspring. Inherited traits are passed genetically from parents. For example, a bodybuilder’s muscles are an acquired trait, while eye color is an inherited trait.</p>
