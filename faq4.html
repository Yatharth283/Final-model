        <h2>1. Covalent Bonding in Carbon Compounds</h2>
        <h3>Q1: Explain the nature of covalent bonds in carbon compounds. Why does carbon form covalent bonds?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A covalent bond is formed when two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. Carbon has four valence electrons and needs four more to complete its octet. Since gaining or losing four electrons is not feasible, carbon shares electrons with other atoms to achieve stability. This is why carbon forms covalent bonds.</p>

        <h2>2. Versatile Nature of Carbon</h2>
        <h3>Q2: What are the two characteristic features of carbon that lead to the formation of a large number of compounds?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The two important properties of carbon that lead to the formation of a large number of compounds are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Catenation:</strong> The ability of carbon to form long chains, branched chains, and rings by bonding with other carbon atoms.</li>
            <li><strong>Tetravalency:</strong> Carbon has four valence electrons and can form four covalent bonds with other atoms such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Allotropes of Carbon</h2>
        <h3>Q3: Describe the structure and properties of different allotropes of carbon, such as diamond, graphite, and fullerenes.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Diamond:</strong> Each carbon atom forms four covalent bonds, making it the hardest natural substance. It does not conduct electricity.</li>
            <li><strong>Graphite:</strong> Each carbon atom forms three bonds, leaving one free electron, making it a good conductor of electricity. It has a soft and slippery texture.</li>
            <li><strong>Fullerenes:</strong> Spherical molecules made of carbon atoms (e.g., C₆₀), used in nanotechnology and medicine.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Hydrocarbons</h2>
        <h3>Q4: Differentiate between saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons with examples.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>

        <h2>5. Functional Groups and Homologous Series</h2>
        <h3>Q5: Explain the concept of a homologous series. List its characteristics.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A homologous series is a series of organic compounds that have the same functional group and follow a general formula. Each member differs by a CH₂ unit.</p>
        <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>All members have similar chemical properties.</li>
            <li>Each consecutive member differs by -CH₂ (14 u in molecular mass).</li>
            <li>Physical properties (such as boiling point) show a gradual change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Chemical Properties of Carbon Compounds</h2>
        <h3>Q6: Describe the oxidation reaction of ethanol to ethanoic acid.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Ethanol (C₂H₅OH) is oxidized to ethanoic acid (CH₃COOH) using oxidizing agents like alkaline KMnO₄.</p>
        <p><strong>Reaction:</strong> C₂H₅OH + [O] → CH₃COOH + H₂O</p>

        <h2>7. Soaps and Detergents</h2>
        <h3>Q7: Why are detergents preferred over soaps in hard water?</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Soaps react with calcium and magnesium salts in hard water to form scum, reducing their cleansing ability. Detergents do not form scum and work effectively in both hard and soft water.</p>

        <h2>8. Nomenclature of Organic Compounds</h2>
        <h3>Q8: Write the IUPAC names of the following compounds:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Three-carbon alcohol: <strong>Propanol (C₃H₇OH)</strong></li>
            <li>Four-carbon aldehyde: <strong>Butanal (C₄H₈O)</strong></li>
            <li>Five-carbon carboxylic acid: <strong>Pentanoic acid (C₅H₁₀O₂)</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Isomerism</h2>
        <h3>Q9: Define structural isomerism. Provide examples for C₄H₁₀.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Structural isomerism occurs when compounds have the same molecular formula but different structures.</p>
        <p><strong>Examples of C₄H₁₀ (Butane):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>n-Butane (Straight-chain structure)</li>
            <li>Iso-butane (Branched-chain structure)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Polymers</h2>
        <h3>Q10: What are polymers? Classify polymers with examples.</h3>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> A polymer is a large molecule composed of repeating small units called monomers.</p>
        <p><strong>Types of Polymers:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Natural Polymers:</strong> Found in nature (e.g., Proteins, DNA, Starch).</li>
