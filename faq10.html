        <h1>Chapter 10 - Light: Reflection and Refraction</h1>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>1. What is light? Explain the laws of reflection.</h2>
            <p>Light is an electromagnetic wave that enables us to see objects. It travels in straight lines and exhibits properties such as reflection, refraction, and dispersion. The two laws of reflection state:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</li>
                <li>The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection (∠i = ∠r).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>2. Differentiate between regular and diffused reflection.</h2>
            <p><strong>Regular Reflection:</strong> Occurs when light falls on a smooth surface, such as a mirror, producing a clear image.</p>
            <p><strong>Diffused Reflection:</strong> Happens when light falls on an uneven or rough surface, scattering in different directions and forming no clear image.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>3. Explain the formation of an image by a plane mirror.</h2>
            <p>A plane mirror forms an image that is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Virtual and cannot be projected on a screen.</li>
                <li>Erect and laterally inverted.</li>
                <li>Of the same size as the object.</li>
                <li>At the same distance behind the mirror as the object is in front.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>4. What is a concave mirror? Explain its principal focus and focal length.</h2>
            <p>A concave mirror is a spherical mirror with an inward-curved reflective surface. The <strong>principal focus</strong> is the point where parallel rays meet after reflection. The <strong>focal length</strong> is the distance between the mirror’s pole and its focus.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>5. Derive the mirror formula and explain its terms.</h2>
            <p>The mirror formula is given by:</p>
            <p><strong>1/f = 1/v + 1/u</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>f = Focal length</li>
                <li>v = Image distance</li>
                <li>u = Object distance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This formula helps in locating the image formed by concave and convex mirrors.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>6. What is refraction of light? Explain its causes with the laws of refraction.</h2>
            <p>Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to a change in its speed. The laws of refraction state:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The incident ray, refracted ray, and normal to the interface all lie in the same plane.</li>
                <li>Snell's Law: <strong>sin(i)/sin(r) = constant</strong>, where ‘i’ is the angle of incidence and ‘r’ is the angle of refraction.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>7. Define the refractive index and write its mathematical formula.</h2>
            <p>The refractive index (n) is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum (c) to its speed in a medium (v). It is given by:</p>
            <p><strong>n = c/v</strong></p>
            <p>A higher refractive index means the medium is optically denser.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>8. What is the lens formula? How is it different from the mirror formula?</h2>
            <p>The lens formula is given by:</p>
            <p><strong>1/f = 1/v - 1/u</strong></p>
            <p>The main difference from the mirror formula is the sign convention used in calculations.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>9. What is the power of a lens? How is it measured?</h2>
            <p>The power of a lens (P) is defined as the ability to converge or diverge light. It is measured in diopters (D) and is given by:</p>
            <p><strong>P = 100/f (if f is in cm) or P = 1/f (if f is in meters).</strong></p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>10. Explain total internal reflection. Give two applications.</h2>
            <p>Total internal reflection occurs when light traveling from a denser to a rarer medium is completely reflected at the boundary, rather than refracted. It happens when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle.</p>
            <p><strong>Applications:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Optical fibers – Used in communication and medical endoscopy.</li>
                <li>Mirage – A natural phenomenon seen in deserts due to temperature variations.</li>
            </ul>
