        <h1>Electricity - Chapter 12</h1>
        
        <h2>Atomic Structure</h2>
        <p>An atom consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, with electrons revolving around it in discrete energy levels.</p>
        <p>Electrons are responsible for electrical conduction in materials, especially in metals.</p>
        
        <h2>Valence Electrons and Electric Current</h2>
        <p>Valence electrons are the outermost electrons in an atom. In metals, these electrons are loosely bound and move freely, forming an electric current when a potential difference is applied.</p>
        <p>The movement of these free electrons constitutes electric current in a conductor.</p>
        
        <h2>Charge</h2>
        <p>Charge is the fundamental property of matter, measured in coulombs (C). An electron has a charge of -1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.</p>
        <p>Like charges repel each other, while opposite charges attract.</p>
        
        <h2>Conductors and Insulators</h2>
        <p>Conductors, such as copper and aluminum, allow the easy flow of electric current due to free electrons.</p>
        <p>Insulators, such as rubber and glass, have tightly bound electrons and resist the flow of current.</p>
        
        <h2>Electric Potential and Potential Difference</h2>
        <p>Electric potential is defined as the work done per unit charge in bringing a charge from infinity to a specific point.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> V = W/Q, where V is potential, W is work done, and Q is charge.</p>
        <p>Potential difference between two points drives current through a circuit.</p>
        
        <h2>Electric Current (I)</h2>
        <p>Electric current is the rate of flow of charge through a conductor.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> I = Q/t, where I is current, Q is charge, and t is time.</p>
        <p>SI unit of current is Ampere (A).</p>
        
        <h2>Drift Velocity of Electrons</h2>
        <p>Drift velocity is the average velocity attained by free electrons in a conductor due to an electric field.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> v_d = I / (nAq), where n is the number of charge carriers per unit volume, A is the cross-sectional area, and q is the charge of an electron.</p>
        
        <h2>Battery and Its Working</h2>
        <p>A battery consists of electrochemical cells that convert chemical energy into electrical energy.</p>
        <p>It maintains a potential difference that drives the flow of electrons.</p>
        
        <h2>Electric Circuit</h2>
        <p>An electric circuit is a closed path through which electric current flows.</p>
        <p>It consists of components such as resistors, capacitors, and voltage sources.</p>
        
        <h2>Resistance and Ohm’s Law</h2>
        <p>Ohm’s Law states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> V = IR, where R is resistance.</p>
        
        <h2>Factors Affecting Resistance</h2>
        <p>Resistance depends on material, length, temperature, and cross-sectional area.</p>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> R = ρl/A, where ρ is resistivity.</p>
        
        <h2>Ohmic and Non-Ohmic Resistors</h2>
        <p>Ohmic resistors follow Ohm’s Law (e.g., metals), while non-ohmic resistors (e.g., diodes) do not.</p>
        
        <h2>Superconductors</h2>
        <p>Superconductors have zero resistance below a critical temperature.</p>
        
        <h2>Combination of Resistors</h2>
        <p>Series: <strong>R_eq = R₁ + R₂ + ...</strong></p>
        <p>Parallel: <strong>1/R_eq = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...</strong></p>
        
        <h2>EMF and Terminal Voltage</h2>
        <p>Electromotive Force (EMF) is the potential difference when no current flows.</p>
        <p>Terminal voltage is the potential difference when current flows.</p>
        
        <h2>Heating Effect of Current (Joule’s Law)</h2>
        <p>Heat energy produced: <strong>H = I²Rt</strong></p>
        
        <h2>Uses of Heating Effect</h2>
        <p>Electric irons, geysers, room heaters, fuses, etc.</p>
        
        <h2>Electric Power</h2>
        <p><strong>Formula:</strong> P = VI, P = I²R, P = V²/R</p>
        <p>Unit: Watt (W). 1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J.</p>
