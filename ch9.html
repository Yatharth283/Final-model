        <h1>Heredity and Evolution - Notes</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction to Heredity and Evolution</h2>
        <p>Heredity and evolution are key principles in biology that explain how traits are passed from one generation to another and how species change over time. Heredity deals with the transmission of genetic information, while evolution explains the gradual development of species.</p>
        
        <h2>Heredity</h2>
        <p>Heredity is the process by which traits and characteristics are transmitted from parents to offspring through genes. It determines physical features, behaviors, and genetic disorders in organisms.</p>
        
        <h2>Genes and Chromosomes</h2>
        <p>Genes are segments of DNA that encode instructions for various traits. They are located on chromosomes, which are thread-like structures present in the nucleus of cells. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, including one pair of sex chromosomes.</p>
        
        <h2>Mendelâ€™s Laws of Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Gregor Mendel conducted experiments on pea plants and formulated laws that explain inheritance patterns:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Law of Dominance:</strong> Some traits dominate over others. Dominant traits are expressed, while recessive traits remain hidden in heterozygous individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Law of Segregation:</strong> Alleles separate during gamete formation, ensuring that each gamete carries only one allele per trait.</li>
            <li><strong>Law of Independent Assortment:</strong> Genes for different traits assort independently during gamete formation.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Sex Determination</h2>
        <p>Sex determination is controlled by chromosomes. Males have XY chromosomes, while females have XX chromosomes. The presence of the Y chromosome determines male characteristics.</p>
        
        <h2>Evolution</h2>
        <p>Evolution is the gradual process by which species change over generations due to genetic variations and environmental pressures.</p>
        
        <h2>Natural Selection</h2>
        <p>Proposed by Charles Darwin, natural selection is the process by which organisms with favorable traits survive and reproduce, passing these traits to future generations.</p>
        
        <h2>Speciation</h2>
        <p>Speciation occurs when populations become genetically distinct due to isolation, leading to the emergence of new species.</p>
        
        <h2>Evidence for Evolution</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fossils:</strong> Preserved remains of ancient organisms show evolutionary changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Homologous Structures:</strong> Similar structures in different species indicate common ancestry.</li>
            <li><strong>Embryology:</strong> Similar embryonic development across species suggests evolutionary relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Molecular Evidence:</strong> Similarities in DNA and proteins support common ancestry.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Fossils and Evolution</h2>
        <p>Fossils provide evidence of extinct species and transitional forms, helping to reconstruct evolutionary history.</p>
        
        <h2>Genetic Drift</h2>
        <p>Genetic drift is a random change in allele frequencies in small populations, leading to evolutionary changes that are not driven by natural selection.</p>
        
        <h2>Artificial Selection</h2>
        <p>Artificial selection is the process by which humans selectively breed organisms to enhance desired traits.</p>
        
        <h2>Homologous and Analogous Organs</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Homologous Organs:</strong> Similar in structure but different in function, indicating common ancestry (e.g., human arm and whale flipper).</li>
            <li><strong>Analogous Organs:</strong> Different in structure but similar in function, evolved due to similar environmental pressures (e.g., bird wings and insect wings).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Embryology and Evolution</h2>
        <p>Comparative embryology shows that embryos of different species undergo similar stages of development, suggesting evolutionary links.</p>
        
        <h2>Human Evolution</h2>
        <p>Human evolution traces back to primates. Fossil evidence shows that early humans evolved from hominids, developing larger brains and complex social structures over millions of years.</p>
        
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Heredity and evolution explain the transmission of traits and the development of life on Earth. These principles are fundamental to understanding biological diversity and adaptation.</p>
