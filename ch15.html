        <h1>Chapter 15: Our Environment</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>The environment encompasses all living and non-living things around us. It plays a vital role in sustaining life by providing essential elements such as air, water, food, and shelter. The study of our environment helps us understand the consequences of human actions and the importance of conservation.</p>
        
        <h2>Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>An ecosystem is a self-sustaining unit consisting of all living organisms (biotic components) and the physical environment (abiotic components) interacting with each other. Examples of ecosystems include forests, rivers, oceans, deserts, and ponds.</p>
        
        <h3>Components of an Ecosystem</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Biotic Components:</strong> These include producers (plants), consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (bacteria, fungi).<br>
            <strong>Abiotic Components:</strong> These include sunlight, temperature, air, water, and soil, which influence the survival of living beings.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Food Chain and Food Web</h2>
        <p>
            A food chain represents a linear sequence of energy transfer from one organism to another. A food web is a more complex system of interconnected food chains, ensuring ecosystem stability.
        </p>
        <h3>Example of a Food Chain</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Grass (Producer) → Deer (Primary Consumer) → Tiger (Secondary Consumer)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Trophic Levels</h2>
        <p>The feeding positions in a food chain are called trophic levels:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Producers (T1):</strong> Plants that synthesize food through photosynthesis.</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Consumers (T2):</strong> Herbivores that eat plants.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Consumers (T3):</strong> Carnivores that consume herbivores.</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary Consumers (T4):</strong> Top predators at the highest level.</li>
            <li><strong>Decomposers:</strong> Organisms that break down dead matter and recycle nutrients.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Biodegradable and Non-Biodegradable Waste</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>Biodegradable Waste:</strong> Organic waste that decomposes naturally (e.g., food scraps, paper, plants).<br>
            <strong>Non-Biodegradable Waste:</strong> Waste that does not decompose easily (e.g., plastic, glass, metals).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Environmental Pollution</h2>
        <p>Pollution is the contamination of the environment by harmful substances, affecting human health and biodiversity.</p>
        
        <h3>Types of Pollution</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Air Pollution:</strong> Caused by emissions from industries and vehicles, leading to respiratory problems and global warming.</li>
            <li><strong>Water Pollution:</strong> Occurs due to waste disposal in water bodies, affecting marine life and human health.</li>
            <li><strong>Soil Pollution:</strong> Results from excessive use of chemicals and plastic waste, reducing soil fertility.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Ozone Layer and Its Depletion</h2>
        <p>
            The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects Earth from harmful UV rays. Human activities, such as the use of CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons), have led to its depletion, causing skin diseases and global warming.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Waste Management</h2>
        <p>Proper waste management techniques include recycling, composting, and reducing plastic use to minimize environmental harm.</p>
        
        <h3>Methods of Waste Disposal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Landfills:</strong> Designated areas for dumping waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Recycling:</strong> Reusing materials to reduce waste.</li>
            <li><strong>Composting:</strong> Converting organic waste into manure.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Energy Flow in an Ecosystem</h2>
        <p>Energy flows through an ecosystem in one direction, following the 10% energy transfer rule, where only 10% of energy is passed from one trophic level to the next.</p>
        
        <h3>Pyramid of Energy</h3>
        <p>The energy pyramid visually represents energy loss at each trophic level.</p>
        
        <h2>Conservation of Environment</h2>
        <p>
            Conservation efforts include afforestation, reducing pollution, and sustainable resource use to maintain ecological balance.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is an ecosystem?</strong> A community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.</li>
            <li><strong>How does pollution affect the environment?</strong> It depletes resources, harms organisms, and causes diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Why is the ozone layer important?</strong> It protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation.</li>
            <li><strong>How can we reduce waste?</strong> By practicing recycling, composting, and reducing plastic usage.</li>
