        <h2>Important Questions</h2>

        <h3>1. Reactions of Acids with Metals</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Describe the reaction between acids and active metals. How can the evolved gas be tested?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Acids react with active metals to produce a salt and hydrogen gas. The presence of hydrogen gas can be confirmed by bringing a burning matchstick near it; a 'pop' sound indicates hydrogen.</p>

        <h3>2. Acid-Base Indicators</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What are acid-base indicators? Provide examples.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Acid-base indicators are substances that change color in acidic or basic solutions. Examples include litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl orange.</p>

        <h3>3. Neutralization Reactions</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the process and significance of neutralization reactions.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Neutralization is the reaction between an acid and a base to form salt and water, releasing heat. This reaction is utilized in various applications, such as treating indigestion with antacids.</p>

        <h3>4. pH Scale and Its Applications</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the pH scale? How is it significant in daily life?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> The pH scale measures the acidity or basicity of a solution, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH less than 7 indicates acidity, while a pH greater than 7 indicates basicity. The pH level is crucial in areas like agriculture, medicine, and environmental science.</p>

        <h3>5. Properties and Uses of Important Compounds</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Discuss the properties and uses of compounds such as baking soda, washing soda, and bleaching powder.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Baking soda is used in baking and as an antacid. Washing soda is employed in cleaning and water softening. Bleaching powder serves as a disinfectant and bleaching agent.</p>

        <h3>6. Water of Crystallization</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Define water of crystallization with examples.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Water of crystallization refers to the fixed number of water molecules present in a crystalline compound. For instance, gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) contains two water molecules.</p>

        <h3>7. Plaster of Paris</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is Plaster of Paris? How is it prepared, and what are its uses?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Plaster of Paris (CaSO₄·½H₂O) is produced by heating gypsum at 373 K. It is utilized in making molds, sculptures, and for setting fractured bones.</p>

        <h3>8. Effect of Acid Rain</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> What is acid rain, and what are its effects on the environment?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Acid rain contains elevated levels of acidic components, such as sulfuric and nitric acids. It can harm aquatic life, damage vegetation, and erode buildings and monuments.</p>

        <h3>9. Common Salt and Its Derivatives</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> Explain the importance of common salt and its derivatives.</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Common salt (sodium chloride) is essential in the diet and serves as a raw material for products like baking soda, washing soda, and bleaching powder.</p>

        <h3>10. pH and Tooth Decay</h3>
        <p><strong>Question:</strong> How does pH relate to tooth decay?</p>
        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Tooth enamel can erode when the pH in the mouth falls below 5.5 due to acidic food and bacterial activity, leading to cavities.</p>
