        <h1>Frequently Asked Questions - Magnetic Effects of Electric Current</h1>
        
        <h2>1. What is the magnetic effect of electric current?</h2>
        <p>When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around it. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current. It was first discovered by Hans Christian Oersted, who demonstrated that a current-carrying wire can deflect a magnetic needle.</p>
        
        <h2>2. What are magnetic field lines? Explain their properties.</h2>
        <p>Magnetic field lines are imaginary lines used to represent the magnetic field around a magnet. Their properties include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>They form closed loops from the north pole to the south pole outside the magnet.</li>
            <li>They never intersect each other.</li>
            <li>The density of lines indicates the strength of the magnetic field.</li>
            <li>The direction of the field at any point is tangential to the field line.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Explain Oersted’s experiment and its significance.</h2>
        <p>Oersted's experiment demonstrated that an electric current can produce a magnetic field. In his experiment, he placed a compass needle near a current-carrying wire and observed its deflection. This proved that electricity and magnetism are interrelated, leading to the development of electromagnetism.</p>
        
        <h2>4. What is the right-hand thumb rule?</h2>
        <p>The right-hand thumb rule states that if you hold a current-carrying conductor in your right hand with the thumb pointing in the direction of the current, then your fingers will curl in the direction of the magnetic field around the conductor.</p>
        
        <h2>5. What is an electromagnet? Mention its applications.</h2>
        <p>An electromagnet is a temporary magnet created by passing an electric current through a coil of wire wound around a magnetic core. Applications of electromagnets include electric motors, transformers, relays, and MRI machines.</p>
        
        <h2>6. What is electromagnetic induction?</h2>
        <p>Electromagnetic induction is the process by which a changing magnetic field induces an electric current in a conductor. This phenomenon was discovered by Michael Faraday and is used in generators, transformers, and induction cooktops.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Explain Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule.</h2>
        <p>Fleming’s Left-Hand Rule states that if the forefinger, middle finger, and thumb of the left hand are held mutually perpendicular:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The forefinger represents the direction of the magnetic field.</li>
            <li>The middle finger represents the direction of current.</li>
            <li>The thumb represents the direction of the force (motion).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. What is the principle of an electric motor?</h2>
        <p>An electric motor works on the principle that a current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force. This force creates rotational motion, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy.</p>
        
        <h2>9. Explain Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule.</h2>
        <p>Fleming’s Right-Hand Rule states that if the thumb, forefinger, and middle finger of the right hand are held perpendicular to each other:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The forefinger represents the magnetic field.</li>
            <li>The thumb represents the direction of motion.</li>
            <li>The middle finger represents the direction of the induced current.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>10. What is the working principle of an electric generator?</h2>
        <p>An electric generator works on the principle of electromagnetic induction. When a coil rotates in a magnetic field, a current is induced in the coil due to the changing magnetic flux. This induced current is then used to generate electricity.</p>
