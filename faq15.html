    <div class="question">
        <h2>1. What is an ecosystem? Explain its components.</h2>
        <p>An ecosystem is a biological community where living organisms interact with each other and their non-living environment. It includes two main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Biotic Components:</strong> These are the living organisms in an ecosystem, including producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria and fungi).</li>
            <li><strong>Abiotic Components:</strong> These include non-living factors such as sunlight, air, water, temperature, and minerals that influence the ecosystem.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>2. Explain the concept of the food chain with an example.</h2>
        <p>A food chain is a sequence that shows how energy and nutrients flow from one organism to another. It consists of different trophic levels:</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grass (Producer) → Grasshopper (Primary Consumer) → Frog (Secondary Consumer) → Snake (Tertiary Consumer) → Eagle (Top Predator)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>3. What is a food web? How is it different from a food chain?</h2>
        <p>A food web is a complex network of multiple interconnected food chains. It represents various feeding relationships in an ecosystem, unlike a linear food chain, which shows a single pathway of energy flow.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>4. Why are decomposers important for the environment?</h2>
        <p>Decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down dead organisms and organic waste, recycling nutrients back into the ecosystem. This process maintains soil fertility and keeps the environment clean.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>5. What are trophic levels? Explain with an example.</h2>
        <p>Trophic levels are the different stages in a food chain, where each level represents an organism's position in the energy flow. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Plants and algae (Trophic Level 1)</li>
            <li><strong>Primary Consumers:</strong> Herbivores like rabbits (Trophic Level 2)</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Consumers:</strong> Carnivores like snakes (Trophic Level 3)</li>
            <li><strong>Tertiary Consumers:</strong> Top predators like eagles (Trophic Level 4)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>6. What happens to the energy as we move up the trophic levels?</h2>
        <p>According to the 10% law, only 10% of the energy is transferred to the next trophic level, while 90% is lost as heat. This limits the number of trophic levels in a food chain.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>7. What are biodegradable and non-biodegradable substances? Give examples.</h2>
        <p><strong>Biodegradable Substances:</strong> These decompose naturally by microorganisms. Examples: Vegetable peels, paper.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Biodegradable Substances:</strong> These do not decompose easily and remain in the environment for years. Examples: Plastic, glass.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>8. How do human activities affect the environment?</h2>
        <p>Human activities like deforestation, pollution, and excessive use of resources lead to climate change, habitat destruction, and loss of biodiversity.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>9. What is biological magnification? Explain with an example.</h2>
        <p>Biological magnification refers to the accumulation of toxic substances, such as pesticides, in organisms at higher trophic levels. Example: DDT in aquatic food chains affects fish-eating birds.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>10. What are ozone layer depletion and its causes?</h2>
        <p>The ozone layer protects Earth from harmful UV rays. The release of CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) from refrigerators and air conditioners damages this layer, increasing health risks like skin cancer.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>11. Why should we use eco-friendly products?</h2>
        <p>Eco-friendly products reduce pollution, minimize waste, and help conserve natural resources, ensuring a sustainable future.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question">
        <h2>12. How can we manage waste effectively?</h2>
        <p>Effective waste management includes the 3Rs: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Proper segregation of waste into biodegradable and non-biodegradable categories helps in efficient disposal and recycling.</p>
