            <h2>1. Define reflex action. Explain its mechanism with the help of a diagram.</h2>
            <p>A reflex action is an automatic and rapid response to a stimulus that does not involve conscious thought. It is a protective mechanism of the body. The reflex arc is the neural pathway involved in a reflex action, which includes the receptor, sensory neuron, spinal cord, motor neuron, and effector organ.</p>
            <p><strong>Mechanism:</strong> When we touch a hot object, sensory receptors in our skin detect the heat and send a signal through sensory neurons to the spinal cord. The spinal cord processes the information and immediately sends a signal via motor neurons to our muscles, causing us to withdraw our hand.</p>

            <h2>2. What are plant hormones? Name the plant hormones responsible for specific functions.</h2>
            <p>Plant hormones are chemical substances that regulate plant growth and development. The major plant hormones and their functions are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Auxins:</strong> Promote cell elongation, root growth, and phototropism.</li>
                <li><strong>Gibberellins:</strong> Stimulate stem elongation and seed germination.</li>
                <li><strong>Cytokinins:</strong> Promote cell division and delay aging in leaves.</li>
                <li><strong>Abscisic Acid:</strong> Inhibits growth and induces dormancy in seeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Ethylene:</strong> Promotes fruit ripening.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>3. Describe the structure and function of the human brain.</h2>
            <p>The human brain is a complex organ divided into three major parts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Forebrain:</strong> Includes the cerebrum, thalamus, and hypothalamus. It controls sensory functions, voluntary actions, and emotions.</li>
                <li><strong>Midbrain:</strong> Acts as a relay center for sensory and motor pathways.</li>
                <li><strong>Hindbrain:</strong> Includes the cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. It regulates balance, coordination, and involuntary functions like breathing.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>4. Explain phototropism and geotropism in plants with examples.</h2>
            <p><strong>Phototropism:</strong> The growth of a plant in response to light. For example, sunflower stems bend toward sunlight due to auxin accumulation on the shaded side.</p>
            <p><strong>Geotropism:</strong> The growth of a plant in response to gravity. Roots grow downward (positive geotropism), while stems grow upward (negative geotropism).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>5. What is a synapse? Describe how nerve impulses are transmitted across a synapse.</h2>
            <p>A synapse is a junction between two neurons where nerve impulses are transmitted. When an impulse reaches the synaptic terminal, neurotransmitters like acetylcholine are released into the synaptic cleft. These chemicals bind to receptors on the next neuron, generating a new electrical signal.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>6. Differentiate between voluntary and involuntary actions with examples.</h2>
            <p><strong>Voluntary Actions:</strong> Controlled by the brain and performed consciously, like writing or speaking.</p>
            <p><strong>Involuntary Actions:</strong> Automatic and not under conscious control, like heartbeat and digestion.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="faq">
            <h2>7. What is the role of the pituitary gland in the human body?</h2>
            <p>The pituitary gland, known as the "master gland," regulates growth, metabolism, and other endocrine glands. It secretes hormones like growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>8. Why is the use of iodized salt advisable?</h2>
            <p>Iodized salt contains iodine, which is essential for thyroid hormone production. A deficiency can cause goiter and developmental issues.</p>

        <div class="faq">
            <h2>9. Explain the concept of feedback mechanism in hormonal regulation with an example.</h2>
            <p>The feedback mechanism regulates hormone levels. For example, when blood sugar rises, insulin is released to lower it, and when it drops, glucagon is released to increase it.</p>
